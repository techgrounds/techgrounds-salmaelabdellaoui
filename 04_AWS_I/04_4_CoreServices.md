# Core Services
This is a guide to my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. There are a lot of services in AWS, but some are more important than others. AWS lists the following key services that I should have some in-depth knowledge about for the Cloud Practitioner exam:  
  
* Amazon EC2
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Amazon VPC
* Amazon Route 53
* Amazon S3
* Amazon S3 Glacier
* Amazon CloudFront
* Amazon RDS
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon CloudWatch
* Amazon CloudFormation
* AWS Identity and Access Management

Besides the different services, I can also expect questions on cloud concepts, like the Well-Architected Framework or the cloud pricing model, as well as questions on the different support categories.
