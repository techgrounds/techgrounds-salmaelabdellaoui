# AWS Config
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

#### Benefits 
AWS Config makes it easier to track your resourceâ€™s configuration without the need for upfront investments and avoiding the complexity of installing and updating agents for data collection or maintaining large databases. Once you enable AWS Config, you can view continuously updated details of all configuration attributes associated with AWS resources.

AWS Config makes it easier to monitor compliance status across multiple accounts and Regions using the multi-account, multi-Region data aggregation capability. You can create a configuration aggregator in any account and aggregate the compliance details from other accounts.

#### Rules 
     Config Rules are predefined or custom rules that you can use to evaluate your AWS resource configurations. AWS provides a set of predefined rules based on AWS best practices, and you can create custom rules to match your specific compliance requirements.

AWS Config is valuable for governance, compliance, and auditing purposes, providing visibility into the state of your AWS resources and helping you maintain a secure and compliant environment. It is commonly used in environments where regulatory compliance and best practices adherence are critical.
