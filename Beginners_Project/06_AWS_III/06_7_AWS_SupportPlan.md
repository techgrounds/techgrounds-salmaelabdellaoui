# AWS Support Plans 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers several support plans designed to meet the varying needs of customers. These support plans provide access to AWS resources, technical support, and additional benefits. Keep in mind that AWS may update its offerings, so I recommend checking the official AWS website for the most current information.

__AWS Support offers five support plans:__

1. #### Basic Support:
   Basic Support is the free plan available to all AWS customers. It includes access to the AWS Knowledge Center, documentation, forums, and customer service for billing and account issues. However, it doesn't provide access to technical support specialists.
2. #### Developer Support:
   Developer Support is a cost-effective plan for individuals and small businesses running non-production workloads. It includes access to customer service, general guidance, and assistance with best practices. Technical support is available during business hours via email.
3. #### Business Support:
   Business Support is suitable for production workloads. It includes 24/7 access to Cloud Support Engineers for operational issues and guidance. Business Support customers can use chat, email, or phone to contact support. It also includes architectural guidance, best practices, and access to the AWS Trusted Advisor tool.
4. #### Enterprise Support:
    Enterprise Support is designed for organizations with mission-critical workloads. It provides 24/7 access to a Technical Account Manager (TAM) who offers proactive guidance and assistance with operational and technical issues. Enterprise Support includes architectural reviews, well-architected reviews, and access to AWS Trusted Advisor.
5. #### AWS Support Plans for Amazon EC2 Instances:
   AWS also offers support plans specifically tailored for Amazon EC2 instances. These plans provide a higher level of support for EC2 instances, including direct access to EC2 experts, proactive guidance, and assistance with performance optimization.

Each support plan comes with different levels of access, response times, and additional features. Customers can choose the plan that best aligns with their needs and the criticality of their workloads.
