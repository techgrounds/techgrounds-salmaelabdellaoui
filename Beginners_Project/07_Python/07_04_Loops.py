# Excercise 1
# Create a variable x and give it the value 0
x = 0

# Use a while loop to print the value of x and increment it until x is greater than 10
while x <= 10:
    print("Current value of x:", x)
    x += 1  # Increment x by 1 in each iteration


# Exercise 2   
# Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script
x = 5

# Using a for loop with range(10)
for i in range(10):
    # Print the value of i in the for loop
    print("Value of i:", i)

# Using a for loop with range(50) to print the value of x multiplied by i
for i in range(50):
    result = x * i
    print(f"Value of x * i for iteration {i}: {result}")


# Exercise 3 
# Copy the array into your script
arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]

# Use a for loop to loop over the array and print every name individually
for name in arr:
    print(name)
